To what extent do attitudes toward immigration explain the switching of votes of 2012
Obama supporters who became 2016 Trump supporters?
Polls have shown that people from certain demographic groups were more likely to switch their
votes than others. But what might explain why some people within a group switched, while others
didn’t? One theory is that attitudes toward immigration became especially salient during the 2016
campaign. Most attempts I’ve seen to assess this have involved fitting big, complicated logistic
regression models. This is useful but not really sufficient to study this problem, so YOU will
explore the data and then fit a big and complicated logistic regression model. We won’t attempt
to assess cause-and-effect, but we can get a sense of whether attitudes toward immigration had
explanatory power over and above demographic shifts.

•	Engineered the raw data to extract features which would explain the immigration attitude in numerical scale based on the Survey data.
•	Analyzed the effects of Immigration attitude on all demographic variables available in the data and found visible interactions of variables for modeling purpose.
•	Implemented Logistic Model to attain the Probabilities of switch (Obama to Trump) concluding 25% pf Obama Voters switched Votes to Trump in 2016 Election
